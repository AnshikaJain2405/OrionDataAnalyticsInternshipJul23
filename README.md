# OrionDataAnalyticsInternshipJul23
Credit Card default is a common issue that banks face each month. This project focuses on using the data provided by one such bank and working on that data. During this project I learned to clean the data, and then train it to be used to create an effective model identifying defaulters.
A number of models were applied to train the dataset, including random forest, logistic regression, SVM, and naive bayes. I learnt about interactive tables, visual EDA, and the various classification models that can be applied for the best results. 
This project helps to find which user will default in the upcoming month based on the given demographics.

I also learned how to document my project findings in a report using quarto for jupyter.
